# Note taking app

I made this project to understand and practice my knowledge of node.js.
The project is a note-taking app that runs on terminal and allow you to add, remove, list, and view a note. With the use of different npm modules like yargs to make it easier to get input from the user, to chalk to have a colored output on the terminal window.
